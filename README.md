Simple skeleton with libgdx. 

## How to run
Go to `src/main/java/inf112/skeleton/app/Main.java` and run `main` function.


## Known bugs
Currently throws "WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred", 
when the java version used is >8. This has no effect on function or performance, and is just a warning.

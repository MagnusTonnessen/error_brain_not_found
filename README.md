The program runs `java` and `maven`, these need to be installed.  
Every text-editor that can run version control system, can be used. We recommend IntelliJ IDEA.

## Known bugs
Currently throws "WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred", 
when the java version used is >8. This has no effect on function or performance, and is just a warning.
